# Static Files #

The authentication views and templates work, but they look very plain right now. Some CSS can be added to add 
style to the HTML layout you constructed. The style won't change, so it's a *static* file rather than a template.

Flask automatically adds a `static` view that takes a path relative to the `flaskr/static` directory and serves it. The 
`base.html` template already has a link to the `style.css` file:

`{{ url_for('static', filename='style.css') }}`

Besides CSS, other types of static files might be files with JavaScript functions, or a logo image. They are all placed 
under the `flaskr/static` directory and referenced with `url_for('static', filename='...')`.

This tutorial isn't focused on how to write CSS, so you can just copy the following into the 
`flaskr/static/style.css` file.
